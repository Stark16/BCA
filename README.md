# 🚀 **Business Card Recognition System (BCA) (PAUSED)**  

## ❌ **The Problem**  
At business fairs, sales teams collect numerous business cards but face major challenges in managing them efficiently:  

- **Unorganized Collection** – Business cards are gathered in a single bowl, while interaction details are separately recorded in a diary.  
- **Loss of Critical Information** – Due to time constraints, the diary lacks a direct link to business card details.  
- **Incomplete Discussion Logs** – Important client requirements, interests, and special requests are often forgotten.  
- **Delayed Follow-Ups** – Late communication can result in lost opportunities as clients may forget discussions or engage with competitors.
